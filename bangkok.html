                <span>Bangkok</span>, the capital of Thailand, infamous for it's <span>bustling street-food stalls, shopping malls and busy roads.</span> The pace is nothing short of electric. Swanky Sukhumvit is the city's bustling modern center, while the infamous <span>Khao San Road</span> is the starting point for many a heavy night. Those after something a touch less hectic can enjoy <span>stunning views</span> and superb cocktails in one of Bangkok's myriad rooftop bars. A sense of calm amongst the chaos can be found at the riverside <span>Grand Palace and nearby Wat Pho,</span> with its huge <span>reclining Buddha.</span>

            <h2>Cuisine</h2>
            <p>
                Food in Bangkok, Thailand is <span>incredibly diverse and just as tantalisingly tasty.</span> Bangkok, as the largest city and the capital, encompasses <span>a great number of cultures and cuisines</span>. Thai food is known for <span>spice and seafood</span>; however, they take influences from many other places, too. There is a lot that makes Thai food so special worldwide, so let’s see what dances on the taste buds when we try Bangkok’s cuisine.
            </p>
            <p2>
                Food in Bangkok is often <span>very spicy and pungent in its aroma</span>. Bangkok’s cuisine involves a delicate hand and attention to detail. <span>Texture, taste and colour </span> come together to form the special dishes. Due to being located near the sea, Bangkok’s cuisine is <span>rich in seafood</span>. Other <span> key ingredients are pork, fresh fish, palm sugar and coconut milk.</span> There is no one cuisine in Bangkok, due to Thailand’s <span>cultural diversity.</span> There is thought to be <span>over 40 ethnic groups in Thailand</span>, and therefore each of these groups have brought with them their own cultures that then influences the food. Thai people often <span>prefer to use fresh spices and herbs over dried ones</span>. <span>Chicken and pork</span> are the most common meats, <span> except for with the Muslim Thais who favour mutton and goat.</span> Very popular and common flavourings <span> include: garlic, coriander, galangal, cilantro, lemon grass, pepper, fish sauce, kaffir lime leaves, chillies, shallots, and shrimp paste. Shellfish and crustaceans</span> are also <span> key in Bangkok’s cuisine. </span>

            <p>
                Make sure to add these places to your itinerary the next time you visit Bangkok:

                <li><span>Chatuchak Weekend Market:</span> Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok (locally known as JJ Market) was once only popular among wholesalers and traders, but it has now reached landmark status as a must-visit place for visitors to the Thai capital.
