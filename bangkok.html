    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Bangkok</span>, the capital of Thailand, infamous for it's bustling street-food stalls, shopping malls and busy roads. The pace is nothing short of electric. Swanky Sukhumvit is the city's bustling modern center, while the infamous Khao San Road is the starting point for many a heavy night. Those after something a touch less hectic can enjoy stunning views and superb cocktails in one of Bangkok's myriad rooftop bars. A sense of calm amongst the chaos can be found at the riverside Grand Palace and nearby Wat Pho, with its huge reclining Buddha.

    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    <p>
        Food in Bangkok, Thailand is incredibly diverse and just as tantalisingly tasty. Bangkok, as the largest city and the capital, encompasses a great number of cultures and cuisines. Thai food is known for spice and seafood; however, they take influences from many other places, too. There is a lot that makes Thai food so special worldwide, so let’s see what dances on the taste buds when we try Bangkok’s cuisine.
    </p>
    <p2>
        Food in Bangkok is often very spicy and pungent in its aroma. Bangkok’s cuisine involves a delicate hand and attention to detail. Texture, taste and colour come together to form the special dishes. Due to being located near the sea, Bangkok’s cuisine is rich in seafood. Other key ingredients are pork, fresh fish, palm sugar and coconut milk. There is no one cuisine in Bangkok, due to Thailand’s cultural diversity. There is thought to be over 40 ethnic groups in Thailand, and therefore each of these groups have brought with them their own cultures that then influences the food. Thai people often prefer to use fresh spices and herbs over dried ones. Chicken and pork are the most common meats, except for with the Muslim Thais who favour mutton and goat. Very popular and common flavourings include: garlic, coriander, galangal, cilantro, lemon grass, pepper, fish sauce, kaffir lime leaves, chillies, shallots, and shrimp paste. Shellfish and crustaceans are also key in Bangkok’s cuisine.
