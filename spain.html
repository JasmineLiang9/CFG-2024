                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>
                Current estimates place Spain's population at approximately <span>47 million people</span>. The country's demographic landscape is diverse, comprising various ethnic groups including <span>Castilians, Catalans, Basques, and Galicians</span>, each contributing to Spain's rich cultural mosaic. The majority of Spaniards are Roman Catholic, though the country is increasingly secular. Spain's population distribution is uneven, with the highest densities found in big urban centres like Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia. Coastal areas, particularly along the Mediterranean, also see higher concentrations due to tourism and retirement communities. In contrast, the interior regions, such as Castilla-La Mancha and Extremadura, are more sparsely populated. Spain also has a significant immigrant population, adding to its multicultural character, with large communities from Latin America, North Africa, and Eastern Europe.
